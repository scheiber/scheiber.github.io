# Jonathan's List of Recommended Chrome Extensions
Here's a list of some of my favorite Chrome extensions, along with a brief description of their purpose and why I enjoy them.

## Adblocking
### [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)
Blocks ads, and blocks them well. Fully configurable with custom filters and blocklists. It's recommded to use uBlock Origin as your primary adblocker, since having too many would be redundant.
### [SponsorBlock for YouTube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sponsorblock-for-youtube/mnjggcdmjocbbbhaepdhchncahnbgone)
 Don't you just hate when you're watching a YouTube video and then a sponsor appears right in the middle? I know I do. Get rid of those pesky ads with SponsorBlock. Sourced by the community, it allows for automatic and manual skipping of all kinds of video annoyances, from self-promotion to non-music portions of music videos.
