## Security

### [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)

To protect yourself online, using a password manager is paramount. That said, I have found no better password manager than Bitwarden.

If you're not sure what a password manager is, or why you should use this one as opposed to the one included in Chrome, allow me to summarize. The idea is that instead of reusing your password or variations of it on every site, or remembering a different password for every site you use, a password manager requires you to remember a single very strong password, and then it generates different secure passwords for you to use on individual sites. Since you don't have to remember these passwords, they can be extra complex, and Bitwarden will remember and protect them for you.

Additionally, it's not recommended to use a password manager that is tied to your web browser since it may be difficult to take your passwords with you if you decide that you want to use a different one.

It's quite simple to set up and use, supported on many different platforms (including iOS/Android, Chrome/Firefox, Mac/Windows/Linux), is [open-source](https://github.com/bitwarden), and has a [growing community of passionate users](http://www.reddit.com/r/bitwarden).

## Adblocking

### [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)

Blocks ads, and blocks them well. Fully configurable with custom filters and blocklists. It's recommended to use uBlock Origin as your primary adblocker, since having too many would be redundant.

### [SponsorBlock for YouTube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sponsorblock-for-youtube/mnjggcdmjocbbbhaepdhchncahnbgone)

Don't you just hate when you're watching a YouTube video and then a sponsor appears right in the middle? I know I do. Get rid of those pesky ads with SponsorBlock. Sourced by the community, it allows for automatic and manual skipping of all kinds of video annoyances, from self-promotion to non-music portions of music videos.

## Notifiers

### [Checker Plus for Gmail](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/checker-plus-for-gmail/oeopbcgkkoapgobdbedcemjljbihmemj)

Have a Gmail account? Of course you do. Therefore, you need Checker Plus for Gmail. In addition to notifying you about new email, it includes oodles of neat features and customization galore. Of note is multiple account support, colorful themes, custom alert sounds, and the ability to read and archive mail without having to leave your current tab. Your email never looked this good.

## Development

### ***[NEW]*** [View Rendered Source](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/view-rendered-source/ejgngohbdedoabanmclafpkoogegdpob/)

This handy little extension lets you not only view the raw HTML source of a webpage, but also any modifications that are rendered on the page using JavaScript, plus it highlights the differences. An indispensable tool for any web developer.

### ***[NEW]*** [Clear Cache](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clear-cache/cppjkneekbjaeellbfkmgnhonkkjfpdn)

A simple, magic button that lives in your toolbar and allows you to clear your cache with a single click. No more navigating through complicated settings panels to purge your browsing data. Heavily customizable to let your clear history, downloads, cookies, and much more.

## Utility

### [Better History](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-history/egehpkpgpgooebopjihjmnpejnjafefi)

Sure, Chrome already has a history feature. This is just a better way to access it, hence the name. Notable features include quick access with a toolbar icon, dark mode, one-click delete, delete by hour, and a button to find all entries from a particular site. Celebrate your browser's past by deleting some of it.

### [Save to Pocket](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-pocket/niloccemoadcdkdjlinkgdfekeahmflj)

Want to read an article but don't have the time right now? Put it in your pocket for later! [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) is a service that lets you save websites, articles, and even videos in once place that you can access at your leisure. With apps available for iOS, Android, and Mac, you're always able to access your saved items. The Save to Pocket places an icon in your toolbar that adds your current tab to your items with a single click.

### [SingleFile](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/singlefile/mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle)

A wonderful little extension that lets you save the complete contents and layout of any webpage into a single HTML file. Great for archiving. [It's open-source too](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile)!

### [IP Domain Country Flag](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ip-domain-country-flag/mlpapfcfoakknnhkfpencomejbcecdfp)

Have you ever wanted to know where the site that your looking at is hosted, the name of its hosting company or the IP address of its server? Admittedly, this doesn't happen often, but if you ever wondered, have I got the extension for you. IP Domain Country Flag displays a small flag icon that shows where the site your viewing is hosted. Clicking this flag gives you additional information to fulfill all of your curiosities.

### ***[NEW]*** [Return YouTube Dislike](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/return-youtube-dislike/gebbhagfogifgggkldgodflihgfeippi)

Miss the ability to dislike YouTube videos and see how many dislikes a video has? Worry no more. This extension brings it all back, and all is now balanced in the universe.

## Aesthetics

### [Dark Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh)

Turns down the lights and makes blinding white pages dark. Allows you to set preferences per site and can even be invoked with a keyboard shortcut (Shift + Option + D). Your eyes will thank you.
