## Security

### [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
To protect yourself online, using a password manager is paramount. That said, I have found no better password manager than BitWarden.

If you're not sure what a password maanger is, or why you should use this one as opposed to the one included in Chrome, allow me to summerize. The idea is that instead of reusing your password or variations of it on every site, or remembering a different password for every site you use, a password manager requires you to remember a single very strong password, and then it generates individual secure passwords for you to use on different sites. Additionally, it's not recommended to use a password maanger that is tied to your web browser since it may be difficult to take your passwords with you if you decide you want to use a different one.

It's quite simple to set up and use, supported on many different platforms (including iOS/Android, Chrome/Firefox, Mac/Windows/Linux), is [open-source](https://github.com/bitwarden), and has a [growing community of passionate users](http://www.reddit.com/r/bitwarden).

## Adblocking
### [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)
Blocks ads, and blocks them well. Fully configurable with custom filters and blocklists. It's recommded to use uBlock Origin as your primary adblocker, since having too many would be redundant.
### [SponsorBlock for YouTube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sponsorblock-for-youtube/mnjggcdmjocbbbhaepdhchncahnbgone)
 Don't you just hate when you're watching a YouTube video and then a sponsor appears right in the middle? I know I do. Get rid of those pesky ads with SponsorBlock. Sourced by the community, it allows for automatic and manual skipping of all kinds of video annoyances, from self-promotion to non-music portions of music videos.

## Utility

### [IP Domain Country Flag](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ip-domain-country-flag/mlpapfcfoakknnhkfpencomejbcecdfp?hl=en)

Have you ever wanted to know where the site that your looking at is hosted, the name of its hosting company or the IP address of its server? Admittedly, this doesn't happen often, but if you ever wondered, have I got the extension for you. IP Domain Country Flag displays a small flag icon that shows where the site your viewing is hosted. Clicking this flag gives you additional information to fulfill all of your curiosities.
