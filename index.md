### [Weather App](./8-3-weather-app-project/)

This is a weather app I made as an assignment for Pursuit.

It was built with pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Features include current conditions, three-day forecast, and a temperature unit converter.

For weather data, it utilizes the [wttr.in API](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in).

## Personal

### [musicMan](./musicMan/)

musicMan is a way to discover and receive information about recommended albums. It is written in pure JavaScript.

Simply enter a specific genre or the word "random" to receive an album name, artist, and genre.
